We propose the **Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry-Thermometry (AIVT)** method to reconstruct a continuous and differentiable representation of temperature and velocity in turbulent convection from measured 3D velocity data. AIVT is based on **physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (cKANs)** and is trained by optimizing a loss function that minimizes residuals of the velocity data, boundary conditions, and governing equations. 

We apply AIVT to a **unique dataset** containing simultaneously measured 3D temperature and velocity data of Rayleigh-Bénard convection, obtained through a combination of **Particle Image Thermometry (PIT) and Lagrangian Particle Tracking (LPT)**. Unlike previous studies, our approach **directly compares machine learning results to true volumetric, simultaneous temperature and velocity measurements**. 

We demonstrate that AIVT can **reconstruct and infer continuous, instantaneous velocity and temperature fields and their gradients from sparse experimental data**, achieving a fidelity comparable to direct numerical simulations of turbulence. This provides a powerful new avenue for analyzing turbulence at **high Reynolds numbers**.
